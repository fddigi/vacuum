    """Push queued delta rows to Turso and mark them synced locally.

    Each `sync_queue` row becomes one parameterized upsert statement; all pending
    rows (up to `batch_size`) are sent as a single batched round trip. Returns the
    number of rows synced.

    Ported from seng's scraper-core fix (2026-07-23, later re-confirmed
    independently via the vacuum project 2026-09-19: a manual "dismiss" flag
    set directly in Turso by the Worker got silently reset to 0 the next time
    the scraper re-synced that row for an unrelated reason, e.g. a
    reclassification).

    `protected_update_columns`/`conditional_update_columns` exist because this
    function builds its OWN generic UPDATE clause from the payload - it has no
    idea a caller's local-only upsert SQL (e.g. pipeline.py's `_INSERT_SQL`)
    deliberately protects some columns from being clobbered by a re-sync.
    Without these, a manually-curated column (dismiss flag, manually-corrected
    field) protected in the LOCAL sqlite write would still get silently
    overwritten here on the very next Turso sync triggered by an unrelated
    field changing (e.g. a price drop) - found 2026-07-23 via seng project:
    347 of 366 Turso rows had first_seen silently reset to the current run's
    timestamp this way.

    `protected_update_columns`: columns entirely OMITTED from the SET clause on
    an 'update' op (never touched by a re-sync, only ever set at initial INSERT).
    `conditional_update_columns`: column -> raw SQL expression (e.g. a CASE WHEN
    referencing another column, using `:col` for "the new value being set" -
    there is no `excluded` pseudo-table here, see below) used INSTEAD of the
    plain `:col` assignment, again only for 'update' ops.

    'insert' ops (a row's first-ever sync) use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO
    NOTHING` with the FULL payload. 'update' ops (an already-synced row, e.g. a
    partial payload from `LocalStore.enqueue_update()` touching only one or two
    columns) use a PLAIN `UPDATE ... WHERE conflict_col = :conflict_col`
    instead of `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` - deliberately, NOT just a
    style choice: SQLite/libSQL validates NOT NULL constraints for EVERY column
    of the row an upsert WOULD construct, even for columns the ON CONFLICT
    branch would just update on an EXISTING row - so a partial payload used in
    an upsert form always raises "NOT NULL constraint failed" for whichever
    required column it omitted, no matter how long the row has already
    existed. Found 2026-07-23 in production: this made essentially every
    partial-payload sync fail, not just genuinely orphaned rows as first
    suspected. A plain UPDATE has no such requirement, since it never
    constructs a new row.
